            <h3>Project 2: Car recommendation project </h3>
            <p>The project explores advanced text analytics using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop a car recommendation engine. This system not only suggests similar car models to users but also provides concise summaries of owner reviews, enhancing user decision-making. Created in a week as part of a bootcamp coursework, the project focuses on extracting valuable insights from large datasets of customer reviews on different car models.

              The necessity for this engine arises from the challenge of manually summarizing extensive unstructured data, which is time-consuming and impractical. By integrating document classification and summarization, the system ensures that the summaries reflect a range of topics that interest users, rather than concentrating on repetitive themes.

              Technically, the project employs a bag-of-words model for initial classification followed by logistic regression for more refined analysis, using tools like NLTK and scikit-learn. The data, segmented into categories such as engines, interiors, and practicality, aids in training the classification model effectively. Sentences classified under these topics are then summarized using state-of-the-art models like BART and Pegasus, the latter preferred for its thematic consistency in summaries.

              Executed on the Google Cloud Platform, this project showcases a robust method of handling and summarizing textual data, which could be adapted to various other domains, demonstrating significant potential beyond its initial automotive focus.</p>
